		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>
	<h4>What is this?</h4>
	<p class="text">&raquo;WISP&laquo; is a simple password prompter.</p>
	
	<h4>Why should I use one?</h4>
	<p class="text">Common passwords are not safe. All passwords that contain words which can be found in a dictionary are vulnerable to attack. The same applies to passwords that are to short. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi&amp;s=articles">article</a> to find out how long your password would stand against brute force attacks. Also take into account that computing power <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">doubles every two years</a>.<br/>
	However, people choose these passwords because they are easy to remember, putting themselves and others at risk.<br/>
	&raquo;WISP&laquo; lets you choose an "easy to remember"-password and gives you a "hard to guess"-password in return.<br/></p>

	<h4>How does it work?</h4>
	<p class="text">When a user enters a &raquo;weak password&laquo; that hasn't been used before, two &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; are generated at random.<br/>
	Once created, the passwords are stored in a database and are linked to that specific &raquo;weak password&laquo; from now on. This means, you can always come back and retrieve your &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; with the appropriate &raquo;weak password&laquo;.</p>

	<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
	<p class="text">You might find it confusing that the passwords are available to everyone, but out of context they usually serve no purpose.<br/>
	However, you should not use a too easily guessable &raquo;weak password&laquo;, like "password" or any of the other among the <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">500 most common passwords</a>.<br/>
	Using "facebook" for your Facebook account isn't smart either.<br/>
	The data itself is transmitted with 128-bit encryption via TLS 1.0. The app runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google Appengine</a> servers, which means that it is accessible at all times and even through major catastrophes.<br/></p>
	
	<h4>Why are there so many passwords?</h4>
	<p class="text">Another problem that comes for the same reasons is <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">password reuse</a>. In order to mitigate this effect, two &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; are given: One for sites you trust and another for those you're not sure about. They are both linked to the same &raquo;weak password&laquo;.<br/>
